## How this works?
* Markdown repository: https://github.com/strubloid/testbook
* Each folder it's like a book, and each files inside of it they are considered chapters, and the content of each file its the chapter content.
* At the first time its loaded the information provided from github API, and set this into an object that will contain further information for the chapter's
* When a book is selected, all chaptars will be fetched by the github book fetch, and will be loaded all content from the book
